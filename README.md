## Overview
### Brief
To create a Help Queue Spring Boot Application with full CRUD functionality, with 3 additional features from a list provided 

### Requirements
- Create a user interface using React
- Implement full CRUD functionality including 2/3 additional features from list provided.
- Containerise application using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Integrate a working CI Pipeline for automation using Jenkins 
- Deploy application into testing and production environment
- Use Terraform to create Infrastructure required 
- Use Ansible to configure the environment
- Deploy application into a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS for production.
### Our Approach
The additional features we have decided to implement as a team are as follows:
- Solutions - so users can add solutions to a ticket. All solutions will be stored in a separate database.  
- Urgency - so a level of urgency can be assigned to a ticket, based upon value stored in an urgency field in the ticket table
- Topics - so topics can be assigned to tickets, based upon a field stored in a topic field in the ticket table.

### Terraform
<span style="color:red">What does terraform set up?

### Ansible
Ansibles key role is to increase the automation of the deployment of this application. We have used it to install and configure several dependencies which would otherwise have to be done manually. The installs take place on the instances created using terraform. Currently, there are 3 installs we have automated this way;  
**1. Jenkins**,  
On the Jenkins Host, following an SCP of a script to create a jenkins user and install it. After this, another SCP takes place which holds the desired jenkins configuration (Users, Plugins, Jobs & UI)  
**2. AWS CLI**,   
On the jenkins host, which is used to deploy the application on the Kuberenetes cluster  
**3. Docker & Docker-Compose**,  
On the Jenkins host, which is used to push the most recent images to dockerhub
On the test EC2, which is used to pull and test the most recent images from dockerhub  


### Jenkins
